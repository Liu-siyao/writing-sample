On a stronger version of Meinongianism--Consider a proper alternative to modern fictionalism

Intro
Fictionalism is a popular anti-realist view in widespread philosophical debates recently. It considers discourse as a fiction and denies its truth value.

Version 1: I will consider the problem of arbitrary reference, namely, reference gap between ordinary discouse and utterance about non-existent object in this paper and raise a stronger version of Breckenridge and Magidor's theory.

Version 2: I will raise a theory that considers composition as a non-existent object in Meinongian view, in comparison with Rosen and Cior's Composition as a Fiction.

Version 3: Consider a fictionalism view of respond to Nathaniel Gan shows why Meinongian is not a good alternative to modern fictionalism in an anti-realist way.

Meinong is famous for his theory of objects. For he claimed that “object” not only attributes to those existent specific things or generally existent universals, and also contains those non-existent things, which are objects that do not exist but have objective characteristics, so that we can say there may be entities like the round square. And insofar as that we can describe objects precisely far beyond their already existent contents.

Meinong pointed out that every object has "characteristics", and the characteristics are independent of the existence of the object; some objects do not have characteristics that contradict its existence, which he calls "possible objects". Some of these possible objects exist and some do not exist, such as the golden mountain. He also pointed out that some objects have the characteristics that contradict or even repel its existence, which he calls "impossible objects". Such objects can not be found in reality, e.g. “the square of a circle”. In his view, all objects whether their characteristics and existence are contradictory or not, are not created by us, nor do they depend on our thinking activities. He stressed that the object as a whole is far beyond the scope of reality.

That means non-existent objects can be objective and even true. On the other hand, fictionalism holds that non-existent objects can be accepted on account of our practices, but they can not be true.
